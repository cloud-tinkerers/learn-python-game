# Configuring Brython and Getting Started with Python Puzzle Quest

Welcome to Python Puzzle Quest! This is a simple game built using Brython, a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can run the game locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Start a local web server by running the command `python -m http.server 8080` in your terminal.
   
```json
"forwardPorts": [8080],
```

4. Be sure to forward port 8080 in the devcontainer's `forwardPorts` attribute.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## How to Play

Once you have the game running in your web browser, you can use the arrow keys to move your character around the screen. Your goal is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding the enemies. Good luck!
