# Python Puzzle Quest: Game Outline

Python Puzzle Quest is an educational puzzle game with the goal of teaching Python and object-oriented programming. 

The game will run in a web browser, with Python code execution handled by Brython, an implementation of Python 3 that runs in the browser. The game interface and interaction will be handled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## 1. Game Concept

- **Name:** Python Puzzle Quest
- **Genre:** Educational/Puzzle
- **Target Audience:** Beginners to intermediate Python learners
- **Platform:** Web

## 2. Game Design

- **Style:** Mix of 2D and 3D
- **Art:** Simple and minimalistic, to keep the focus on the puzzles and learning Python.
- **Mechanics:** Player solves puzzles by completing Python code snippets or creating algorithms. 

## 3. Game Levels

- **Level 1:** Python Basics (variables, data types, operators)
- **Level 2:** Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- **Level 3:** Functions and Modules
- **Level 4:** Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- **Level 5:** Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
- **Level 6:** Exception Handling and File I/O
- **Level 7:** Python Standard Library (useful modules and packages)
- **Level 8:** Advanced Python (decorators, generators, context managers)
- **Bonus Level:** Real-world Python applications (web scraping, data analysis, machine learning basics)

## 4. Game Development

- **Framework:** Brython (Python execution), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (UI and game interaction)
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code with Devcontainers
- **3D Graphics Library:** Three.js or Babylon.js

## 5. Game Features

- **Code Editor:** Built-in lightweight code editor for writing Python code.
- **Learning Resources:** Links to documentation, tutorials, or explanations for each puzzle.
- **Hint System:** Provide hints or partial solutions for puzzles.
- **Scoring System:** Points earned for correct solutions, time taken, code efficiency, etc.
- **Save/Load:** Ability to save progress and continue later.
- **Multiplayer:** Ability to collaborate on puzzles with other players.

## 6. Game Continuation Ideas

- **User-Generated Content:** Allow players to create and share their own puzzles.
- **Regular Updates:** Add new puzzles and features regularly to keep players engaged.
- **Competitive Mode:** Leaderboards, time trials, etc.
- **Advanced Topics:** Introduce more advanced Python topics in later levels or expansions.
